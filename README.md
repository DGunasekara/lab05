CO222 Tic-Tac-Toe board

program to scan and print a Tic-Tac-Toe board, and to determine whether the game has been won and if so by which player.
Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a grid. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game
(see the following link for details: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).
When scanning the board, we should assume that 0 stands for NOUGHTS, 1 for CROSSES and 2 for an EMPTY cell. Note that to consider the case where both players have achieved full row,
column or diagonal at the same time since this can never occur in a real game.
